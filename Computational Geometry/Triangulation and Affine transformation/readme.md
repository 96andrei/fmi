#Triangulation (Ear cutting/clipping algorithm) + Affine transformation
Contents:
* Step by step visualization of the ear clipping algorithm (simple polygon input).
* Visualization of the resulting polygon after applying an affine transformation (any 2D affine transformation input).
* Step by step visualization of the triangulation of the transformed polygon.

Made with Unity for in-editor use.
